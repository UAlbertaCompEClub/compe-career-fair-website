        "Where and when is Aether happening?": "January 18 - 19th. The remote aspect will occur on the 18th and the in-person (on the 19th) will - tentatively - be at Donadeo Innovation Center for Engineering at the University of Alberta North Campus",
        "How will the remote aspect work?": "TODO!!!",
        "What will the in-person fair be like?": "The in-person part will be like a traditional career fair where each company has its own booth (table size is around  72\" x 32\" and students walk around freely to network with companies of interest. Companies are encouraged to bring some form of promotional material to hand out to students!",
        "Where can I ask additional questions?": "Please reach out to us at external@compeclub.com or on discord (students)!",
        "Why is there a virtual and in-person element?": "We decided to add a new virtual aspect to make the career fair more accessible for companies and students outside of Edmonton and since we noticed the presentation sessions were a complete hit last year!",
        "Can I only attend one or both aspects of the fair": "The virtual and in-person aspects do not overlap so that you can attend both if you choose! This is highly recommended for students since it's likely that companies will only be present for 1 of them.",
        "Will there be food at the in-person event?": "There will only be food served for company representatives and volunteers.",
        "Who is the intended audience for this event?": "This fair is meant for students interested in the tech field and companies hiring for tech roles like Software Developer, Data Scientist, ML Engineer and more - not restricted to Engineering or CS students or 'purely' tech companies."

        "Are there other ways we can connect with students": "Yes! This year we are looking to do smaller-scale events with individual companies at a time to help promote your brand and raise student awareness of the current and future opportunities you offer. This could be focused on going over the application process and providing tips for it, an in-depth exploration of different roles available, or even a technical workshop to teach students a valuable skill. If this new event style is of interest, please let us know!"

We highly encourage first year students interested in tech to also attend!!",
